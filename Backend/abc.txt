make sure :   to use db.json ... first install :  npm install json-server

then  .. to see db.json data on server give command : npx json-server Backend/db.json --watch port 5000 

if you can see the db data on server fronend backend successfully connected 

Here database port is 5000 but it is connecting it to 3000
